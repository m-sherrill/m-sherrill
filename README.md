## Full Stack Web Developer

### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am currently enrolled in a full stack web development certification course with the University of Washington. I'm doing a LOT of learning right now. Things around here will be constantly changing as I grow and develop. 

I'm excited to share and grow as a developer! Check out my portfolio to see some of my latest complete projects.
